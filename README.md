# Tech Grad Product Engineering Task

The Senior Leadership Team (SLT) are worried that our conversion of vehicle purchases isn't where it needs to be. After speaking with DACRO (Data Analytics) and UX (User Experience), they think the problem stems from the fact that it is difficult for customers to find the vehicle they want.â€‹

## Discovery & Ideation

Let's dissect the problem, investigate how the website looks and functions currently. We'll also take a look at what information is available to us in order to help solve the problem. The last part of this step will be spent brainstorming ideas off the back of what we've discovered.

## Planning

Now we have some ideas, it's time to plan out how we might approach these changes before going into development. This is a great time to break down our ideas and form options that we would put back to the business (SLT). I.e. A scalable approach, the fastest approach, the highest quality approach etc.
